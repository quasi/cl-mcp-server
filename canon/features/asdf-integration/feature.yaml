    Phase E: ASDF & Quicklisp Integration

    Provides system-level operations for loading, inspecting, and managing
    Common Lisp systems. Integrates with ASDF (Another System Definition
    Facility) and Quicklisp for dependency management.

    Key capabilities:
    - System information and metadata
    - Dependency graph traversal
    - System loading and compilation
    - Quicklisp search and installation
    - Local system discovery
    - Individual file loading

depends_on:
  core: true
  features:
    - session-management  # Session system state
    - code-evaluator      # Loading code

contracts:
  - describe-system-tool          # Get system information
  - system-dependencies-tool      # Dependency graph
  - list-local-systems-tool       # Find available systems
  - find-system-file-tool         # Locate .asd files
  - quickload-tool                # Load via Quicklisp
  - quicklisp-search-tool         # Search Quicklisp
  - load-file-tool                # Load individual files

properties:
  - system-dependency-accuracy         # Dependency graphs are complete and correct
  - quickload-safety                   # quickload downloads only from trusted sources
  - system-state-tracking              # Loaded systems are tracked accurately
  - load-idempotency                   # Loading same system twice is safe
  - dependency-resolution-correctness  # Transitive dependencies correctly resolved

scenarios:
  - system-inspection          # Understanding a system
  - dependency-analysis        # Analyzing dependencies
  - system-loading             # Loading systems
  - quicklisp-installation     # Installing external libraries
  - local-system-discovery     # Finding available systems
