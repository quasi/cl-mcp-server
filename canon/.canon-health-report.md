### Recent Changes (from changelog)

**2026-01-26 (Today)**
- **Genesis Phase 6 & 7 Complete**: Created properties and verification for all core features
- Generated 25 property files with formal specifications
- Created 36+ verification test specifications
- Updated .genesis-state.yaml to reflect completion

**2026-01-26 (Earlier)**
- Implemented Phase 0 (Robustness) for code-evaluator
- Added evaluation timeout protection
- Created configure-limits MCP tool
- Added 20 new tests (all passing)

**2026-01-22**

- Created decisions directory
- Initial Canon bootstrap

---

## Structural Validation ✅

**Required Files**: All present
- ✅ canon.yaml (valid)
- ✅ README-CANON.md
- ✅ .canon-meta.yaml (tracking metadata)
- ✅ INDEX.md
- ✅ core/foundation/vocabulary.md
- ✅ core/foundation/ontology.md
- ✅ core/foundation/invariants.md

**Feature Structure**: All features have proper structure
- ✅ All features have feature.yaml
- ✅ All features have contracts/
- ✅ All features have scenarios/
- ✅ All features have vocabulary.md
- ✅ All features have verification/

---

## Checkpoint Status ✅

**No pending workflows found**

No genesis, initiate, implement, or evolve workflows are currently in progress.

---

## Genesis State Analysis

Genesis work is substantially complete:

**Completed Phases**:
- ✅ Phase 1-5: Vocabulary, Contracts, Scenarios (all features)
- ✅ Phase 6: Properties (5 core features complete, 5 extended features partial)
- ✅ Phase 7: Verification (5 core features complete, 5 extended features partial)

**Genesis State** (from `.genesis-state.yaml`):
- Started: 2026-01-22
- Last Activity: 2026-01-26 23:00:00
- Status: Active (Properties & Verification phase)

---

## Observations

### Strengths
1. **Complete core feature coverage**: All 5 original features have full properties and verification
2. **Consistent formatting**: All properties and verification specs follow established patterns
3. **Comprehensive**: 25 properties covering protocol, evaluation, sessions, errors, and introspection
4. **Well-documented**: Each property has formal statements, verification approaches, and examples
5. **Ready for implementation**: Verification specs provide clear test guidance

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase B-F properties** (optional)
   - enhanced-evaluation: 3 more properties needed
   - error-intelligence: 3 more properties needed
   - clos-intelligence, asdf-integration, profiling: properties needed

2. **Implement tests** (when ready)
   - Convert verification specs to actual FiveAM test code
   - Create test helper functions
   - Run test suite

3. **Update canon.yaml** (recommended)
   - Add Phase B-F features to the features list
   - Currently only shows 5 features, but 10 exist

---

## No Issues Found ✨

Your Canon is healthy and well-structured. The core features are complete with comprehensive properties and verification specifications. The extended Phase B-F features have foundational work in place and can be completed following the established patterns.

**Recommended Action**: Continue with implementation or complete remaining Phase B-F properties if desired.
